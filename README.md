Python script to determine the most commonly used pixel colors on manga pages

```
python3 extractor.py
```

Run extractor.py to get the graph of most common pixels + most common clusters.

Repo should contain a folder called 'pages' which contains subfolders 'mainstream' and 'other', which each contain manga pages in jpeg.

See stats folder for the actual number of pixels and % of total.

See graphs folder for visualizations.
